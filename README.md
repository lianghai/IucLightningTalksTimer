# IUC Lightning Talks Timer

A simple iOS app in SwiftUI, [originally created](https://twitter.com/lianghai/status/1317266840456896514) for the annual Lightning Talks session of the [Internationalization & Unicode Conference \#44](https://unicodeconference.org).

> I should open source this little app so we can try how much it can be internationalized and localized then we test it at IUC every year!
